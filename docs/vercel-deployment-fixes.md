# Vercel Deployment Fixes

This document explains the fixes for the Vercel deployment issues.

## The Problem

When deploying to Vercel, the build process was failing with the following errors:

1. **Dynamic Server Usage Errors**:
   ```
   Dynamic server usage: Route couldn't be rendered statically because it used `headers`.
   ```
   This error occurred for multiple routes including `/`, `/login`, `/account`, etc.

2. **Missing Suspense Boundary**:
   ```
   useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/login/debug-page".
   ```

## The Solution

### 1. Force Server-Side Rendering

The main issue was that Vercel was trying to statically generate pages that use `headers()`, which is only available in server components. To fix this, we modified `next.config.js` to force server-side rendering for all pages:

```javascript
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  // Force server-side rendering for all pages to fix headers() usage
  output: 'server',
  // Other configurations...
};
```

This tells Next.js to render all pages on the server, which allows the use of `headers()` and other server-only features.

### 2. Wrap useSearchParams in Suspense

For the second issue, we wrapped the `useSearchParams()` hook in a Suspense boundary in the `/login/debug-page.tsx` file:

```jsx
// Main component with suspense boundary
export default function LoginDebugPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Suspense fallback={
        <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-12">
          <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
            <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Login Debug Page</h1>
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
              <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-12 w-12 border-t-2 border-b-2 border-primary mb-4"></div>
              <p className="text-gray-600">Loading...</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      }>
        <LoginContent />
      </Suspense>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

This ensures that the page can handle the loading state properly when using `useSearchParams()`.

## Additional Notes

- The `serverActions` option was removed from `next.config.js` as it's now enabled by default in Next.js 14+.
- These changes should not affect the functionality of the site, but they will change how pages are rendered (server-side instead of static).
- If you need to optimize performance in the future, you can selectively enable static generation for specific pages by adding `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` to those pages.

## Related Issues

These fixes are separate from the middleware fixes for the admin authentication infinite loop issue. However, both sets of changes are necessary for the site to work correctly in production.
