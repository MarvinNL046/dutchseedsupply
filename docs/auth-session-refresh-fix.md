# Authentication Session Refresh Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix authentication issues related to session refreshing.

## Overview

We identified an issue with the authentication system where sessions were not being properly refreshed, leading to users being unexpectedly logged out or experiencing authentication errors. The root cause was that we were using `getSession()` in our middleware, which only retrieves the current session without refreshing it if it has expired.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Session Refresh Logic

The key change was in `utils/supabase/middleware.ts`, where we replaced:

```typescript
// Old code - only gets the session without refreshing
await supabase.auth.getSession();
```

with:

```typescript
// New code - actively refreshes the session if expired
try {
  const { data: refreshedSession, error } = await supabase.auth.refreshSession();
  if (error) {
    // Log the error but don't throw - we'll let the request continue
    // This allows the user to be redirected to login if needed
    console.error('Session refresh failed:', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Session refreshed successfully for user:', refreshedSession?.user?.email);
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Unexpected error during session refresh:', error);
}
```

### 2. Added Error Handling

We added proper error handling to:
- Log errors without crashing the application
- Allow the request to continue even if session refresh fails
- Provide better debugging information

## Why This Fixes the Issue

The `refreshSession()` method is designed to:
1. Check if the current session is valid
2. If valid, return the current session
3. If expired but a refresh token is available, attempt to refresh the session
4. If refresh fails, return an error

By using `refreshSession()` instead of `getSession()`, we ensure that sessions are automatically renewed when possible, preventing unexpected logouts and authentication errors.

## Technical Details

According to Supabase documentation, `refreshSession()` is the recommended method for middleware and server-side components that need to maintain authentication state. It's safe to call even if the session is still valid, as it will simply return the current session without making unnecessary API calls.

## Testing

To verify this fix:
1. Log in to the application
2. Wait for a period longer than the session expiration time (typically 1 hour)
3. Perform actions that require authentication
4. Verify that you remain logged in and can access protected resources

## Additional Recommendations

For optimal authentication flow:
1. Ensure that refresh tokens are properly stored and managed
2. Consider implementing a client-side session refresh mechanism for long-lived pages
3. Add clear error messages for users when authentication genuinely fails
