    "questions": {
      "feminizedSeeds": {
        "question": "What are feminized seeds?",
        "answer": "Feminized cannabis seeds are genetically engineered to produce only female plants. This is beneficial for growers as female plants produce the cannabinoid-rich flowers (buds) that most collectors and growers desire. Using feminized seeds eliminates the need to identify and remove male plants."
      },
      "autofloweringSeeds": {
        "question": "What are autoflowering seeds?",
        "answer": "Autoflowering seeds produce plants that automatically transition from vegetative growth to flowering based on age, rather than light cycle changes. These plants typically grow smaller, mature faster (8-10 weeks from seed to harvest), and are more resilient to environmental stressors, making them ideal for beginners and growers in challenging climates."
      },
      "germination": {
        "question": "What's the best way to germinate cannabis seeds?",
        "answer": "The paper towel method is popular and effective: Place seeds between damp paper towels on a plate, cover with another plate to retain moisture, and keep in a warm, dark place (21-25°C). Check daily and keep towels moist. Seeds typically sprout in 1-5 days. Once taproots appear (2-3mm long), carefully transfer to your growing medium."
      },
      "storage": {
        "question": "How should I store my cannabis seeds?",
        "answer": "For long-term storage, keep seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Ideal conditions are 6-8°C with 20-30% relative humidity. A sealed container in the refrigerator (not freezer) works well. Avoid temperature fluctuations and exposure to light, which can trigger germination or reduce viability."
      },
      "strainDifferences": {
        "question": "What's the difference between Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid strains?",
        "answer": "Indica strains typically produce shorter, bushier plants with broader leaves and denser buds. Sativa strains generally grow taller with narrower leaves and more elongated buds. Hybrids combine characteristics from both parent types. Each strain offers unique growth patterns, flowering times, yields, and effects, allowing collectors to choose based on their preferences and growing conditions."
      },
      "cbdStrains": {
        "question": "What are CBD-rich cannabis seeds?",
        "answer": "CBD-rich cannabis seeds produce plants with higher levels of cannabidiol (CBD) and lower levels of THC. These strains have been specifically bred to enhance the CBD content while minimizing psychoactive effects, making them popular for those interested in the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis without strong intoxication."
      },
      "shipping": {
        "question": "How do you ship cannabis seeds?",
        "answer": "We ship all seeds in discreet, crush-proof packaging with no indication of the contents. Orders are processed within 24-48 hours and typically arrive within 3-7 business days for European countries and 7-14 days for international orders. All shipments include tracking information sent to your email."
      },
      "international": {
        "question": "Do you ship internationally?",
        "answer": "Yes, we ship to most countries where it's legal to import cannabis seeds as a souvenir or collector's item. However, it's the customer's responsibility to check local laws regarding cannabis seeds. We cannot be held responsible for customs seizures, though our discreet packaging minimizes this risk."
      },
      "payment": {
        "question": "What payment methods do you accept?",
        "answer": "We accept credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and various cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Cryptocurrency payments offer an additional layer of privacy and often qualify for a 10% discount on your order."
