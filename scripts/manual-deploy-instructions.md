# Manual Deployment Instructions

Since we're encountering issues with the Vercel CLI deployment, here are instructions to manually deploy the changes to the production website:

## Option 1: Deploy from Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to the Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `dutchseedsupply`
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the "Deploy" button
5. Select the "Production" environment
6. Click "Deploy"

## Option 2: Trigger a Deployment from GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/MarvinNL046/dutchseedsupply
2. Make a small change to any file (e.g., add a comment to README.md)
3. Commit and push the change
4. This will trigger a new deployment on Vercel

## Choosing the Right Middleware

We've created several middleware options to address different issues:

1. **Production Middleware** (`middleware.production.ts`): Prevents infinite loops but still requires authentication
2. **Debug Admin Middleware** (`middleware.debug-admin.ts`): Allows access to admin pages without authentication

If the admin page is not loading at all, you can use the debug admin middleware:

```bash
node scripts/apply-debug-admin-middleware.js
```

This will:
- Back up your current middleware to `middleware.current.ts`
- Apply the debug admin middleware
- Create a restore script

To restore the previous middleware:

```bash
node scripts/restore-current-middleware.js
```

## Verifying the Fix

After the deployment is complete, you can verify that the fix is working by:

1. Go to your production website: https://dutchseedsupply.com
2. Try to access the admin page: https://dutchseedsupply.com/admin
3. If you're using the production middleware and are redirected to the login page, enter your credentials
4. After logging in, you should be redirected back to the admin page without getting stuck in an infinite loop
5. If you're using the debug admin middleware, you should be able to access the admin page directly without authentication

## What We've Done

1. Created a production-optimized middleware that works regardless of the NODE_ENV setting
2. Created a debug admin middleware that allows access to admin pages without authentication
3. Applied these middlewares to your local environment
4. Committed and pushed the changes to GitHub
5. Updated the documentation with detailed information about the fixes

### Production Middleware

The key change in the production middleware is checking if the request is coming from the login page. If it is, we allow access to the admin page to break the infinite loop:

```typescript
// If there's an error or no user, redirect to login
if (error || !user) {
  console.log('No user found, redirecting to login');
  
  // IMPORTANT: Check if we're coming from the login page to prevent infinite loops
  const referer = request.headers.get('referer') || '';
  if (referer.includes('/login')) {
    console.log('Coming from login page, allowing access to prevent infinite loop');
    return response;
  }
  
  // Add the redirect URL as a query parameter
  const redirectUrl = new URL('/login', request.url);
  redirectUrl.searchParams.set('redirect', pathname);
  return NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl);
}
```

### Debug Admin Middleware

The debug admin middleware is much simpler and allows access to all admin pages without authentication:

```typescript
// For admin routes, always allow access
if (pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
  console.log('DEBUG MIDDLEWARE: Allowing access to admin page:', pathname);
  return response;
}
```

These fixes should resolve the issues with admin authentication on your production website.
