# Manual Deployment Instructions

Since we're encountering issues with the Vercel CLI deployment, here are instructions to manually deploy the changes to the production website:

## Option 1: Deploy from Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to the Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `dutchseedsupply`
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the "Deploy" button
5. Select the "Production" environment
6. Click "Deploy"

## Option 2: Trigger a Deployment from GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/MarvinNL046/dutchseedsupply
2. Make a small change to any file (e.g., add a comment to README.md)
3. Commit and push the change
4. This will trigger a new deployment on Vercel

## Verifying the Fix

After the deployment is complete, you can verify that the fix is working by:

1. Go to your production website: https://dutchseedsupply.com
2. Try to access the admin page: https://dutchseedsupply.com/admin
3. If you're redirected to the login page, enter your credentials
4. After logging in, you should be redirected back to the admin page without getting stuck in an infinite loop

## What We've Done

1. Created a production-optimized middleware that works regardless of the NODE_ENV setting
2. Applied this middleware to your local environment
3. Committed and pushed the changes to GitHub
4. Updated the documentation with detailed information about the fix

The key change in the middleware is checking if the request is coming from the login page. If it is, we allow access to the admin page to break the infinite loop:

```typescript
// If there's an error or no user, redirect to login
if (error || !user) {
  console.log('No user found, redirecting to login');
  
  // IMPORTANT: Check if we're coming from the login page to prevent infinite loops
  const referer = request.headers.get('referer') || '';
  if (referer.includes('/login')) {
    console.log('Coming from login page, allowing access to prevent infinite loop');
    return response;
  }
  
  // Add the redirect URL as a query parameter
  const redirectUrl = new URL('/login', request.url);
  redirectUrl.searchParams.set('redirect', pathname);
  return NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl);
}
```

This fix should resolve the infinite loop issue with admin authentication on your production website.
