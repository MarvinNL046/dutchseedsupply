Fix Supabase admin authentication and database setup

This commit includes:

1. New database schema setup:
   - Created new-schema.sql with all tables and RLS policies
   - Added apply-new-schema.js script to apply the schema
   - Created create-execute-sql-function.js to set up required SQL function
   - Added setup-new-database.js to run all scripts in the correct order

2. Admin authentication improvements:
   - Added make-admin.js script to set admin privileges for users
   - Fixed admin authentication in middleware.ts
   - Improved admin dashboard access control

3. Code cleanup:
   - Added cleanup-old-files.js to backup and remove old SQL files
   - Moved old middleware files to backup directory
   - Added documentation in docs/new-database-setup.md

4. Documentation:
   - Added comprehensive guide for setting up the new database
   - Updated README.md with database setup instructions

These changes provide a more robust and maintainable database setup with proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies and admin authentication.
